            "But I don't believe in God?"

            Ideal!  We believe that we can know the creator of the universe and that he loves us more than you could ever imagine.  That's a big deal.  Big important things in life deserve thought and consideration, so when eternal life is on offer we'd say its worth a stop and look!  Maybe you've never thought about it or maybe you're convinced its all made-up nonsense - you are always welcome, we'd love to start a dialogue!

            "Wait so you want me to go do basically chapel in my free time?"
        </h3>
        <p>
            That's exactly right.  The rules at Hub are very simple: absolutely no fun, donuts or friendlines.  In fact, we pride our community on being the most stand-offish and least interesting; there is nothing that sets the way we interact with each other apart.  After sitting in silence for a few minutes quite distinctly not playing a game, we like to then listen to Mr. Ash speak in a very monotone voice about the fiery pits of hell that await non-believers for 2 whole hours.  After a brief gregorian chant, we remove our robes and go our seperate ways, making a point of being unfriendly and cold to other members for the rest of the week.

            "No but seriously"
        </h3>
        <p>
            Despite being mentioned in chapel, the Hub isn't crusty and old fashioned. We are quite proud of the unique atmosphere we have managed to cultivate - you are able to talk to other year groups as equals and meet people you would never talk to otherwise.  We also have a lot of fun, and don't take most things too seriously - only through the Hub could I walk around the HPH with my eyes close making cow noises trying to locate similarly impaired noise makers.  It is ridiculously easy to rock up and make yourself at home, so please do so!
